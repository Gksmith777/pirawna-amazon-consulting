# Amazon Listing Optimization Guide – Pirawna

This document outlines the core principles Pirawna uses to optimize Amazon product listings for visibility, relevance, and conversion.

## 1. Core Elements of a High-Converting Listing

- **Title** – Clear, keyword-rich, readable, not stuffed  
- **Bullet Points** – Benefit-driven, scannable, focused on outcomes  
- **Description / A+ Content** – Story, education, objection-handling  
- **Images** – Clean, lifestyle + infographics, mobile-friendly  
- **Backend Keywords** – Relevant, non-duplicated, no wasted terms  

## 2. Title Best Practices

- Put the **primary keyword** near the front  
- Include brand, product type, key benefit, size/count/flavor if relevant  
- Avoid keyword stuffing that makes the title unreadable  

Example structure:

> Brand + Product Type + Main Benefit/Feature + Size/Variant

## 3. Bullet Point Strategy

Each bullet should:

- Focus on **one main benefit**  
- Connect features to outcomes (what it does for the customer)  
- Use natural language, not a pile of keywords  

## 4. Image Strategy

Listings should include, where possible:

1. Clean main image on white  
2. Lifestyle image showing the product in use  
3. Infographic with key benefits  
4. Dimension/spec image  
5. Before/after or comparison (if allowed)  
6. Packaging or bundle callout  

Images are one of the biggest drivers of conversion rate.

## 5. Backend Search Terms

- Use misspellings, secondary phrases, and adjacent keywords  
- Do not repeat keywords already present in title/bullets  
- Avoid competitor brand names and restricted terms  

## 6. How Pirawna Approaches Optimization

Pirawna analyzes:

- Search term data  
- Click-through rates  
- Conversion rates  
- Session and unit session percentage  
- Category competitors  

From there, we test adjustments to titles, bullets, images, and A+ content to move the needle in a measurable way.
