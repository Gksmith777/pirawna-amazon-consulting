# Amazon PPC Basics – Pirawna

This document summarizes the core principles Pirawna uses to audit, rebuild, and scale Amazon PPC campaigns.

## 1. Main Campaign Types

- **Sponsored Products** – Core workhorse ads  
- **Sponsored Brands** – Top-of-funnel + brand visibility  
- **Sponsored Display** – Retargeting and audience expansion  

We build based on the brand’s margin, catalog size, and growth goals.

## 2. Common Problems We See

- Too many auto campaigns with no structure  
- Duplicated keywords across multiple campaigns  
- No negative keywords, so budgets get drained on junk terms  
- Bids set emotionally, not mathematically  
- No clear separation between branded and non-branded traffic  

## 3. Pirawna’s PPC Framework (Simplified)

1. **Audit** existing campaigns, search term reports, and margin  
2. **Restructure** into logical funnels:
   - Branded vs. non-branded  
   - Exact / phrase / broad where appropriate  
   - Defensive vs. offensive targeting  
3. **Remove waste** by:
   - Adding negatives  
   - Cutting non-performing terms  
   - Adjusting bids down on bad matches  
4. **Scale winners** by:
   - Raising bids intelligently on high-converting terms  
   - Duplicating successful ad groups to new campaigns when appropriate  
5. **Monitor profitability**, not just ACoS:
   - TACoS  
   - Contribution margin  
   - Blended performance across ads + organic  

## 4. Key Metrics We Focus On

- ACoS / ROAS  
- TACoS  
- Conversion rate  
- CPC trends  
- Organic keyword movement  
- True profit after ad spend and fees  

## 5. The Goal

Amazon PPC should not be chaos. The goal is:

- Predictable spend  
- Stable or improving profitability  
- Clear levers to pull when the brand wants to scale
